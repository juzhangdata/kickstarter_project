Question:
How to stack histograms with different data lengths? (y total: 100%)

General Stats:
    
Correlations:
    pledged vs. backers

Funds Raised By Each Campaign
    Pledged Amount ($) vs. Rank Of Campaign By Pledged Amount
Backers Behind Each Campaign
    Number Of Backers vs. Rank Of Campaign By Number Of Backers
Outcomes Of Each Main Category
    Categories vs. Number Of Campaigns, Colored By Outcomes
    Categories vs. Percentage Of Campaigns, Colored By Outcomes
Outcomes Of Each Sub-category
    Sub-Categories vs. Number Of Campaigns, Colored By Outcomes
    Sub-Categories vs. Percentage Of Campaigns, Colored By Outcomes



Inside of Successful, m% are this, n% are that. While inside of failure, m% are this, n% are that...

E.g., separate duration into 5 even bins, m% are in bin 1. 



X: Goal. y: pledged. scatter. 45 degree: meet goal. 



X: Pledged bins. y: counts.  histogram. 



X: 5 ticks for outcomes. Y: numeric columns values, one line for each variable. Line plot. 



It is active if it ends after a specific date. 



X: count of active campaigns that has overlap with this campaign. Y: pledged. Scatter plot. 



And: the most number of active campaigns at the same time. 



Same but:

X: active and with same category. 

X: active and with same sub-category. 

X: active and with same goal



Ending point choice: 

X: year

X: quarter

X: month

X: date

X: day

X: weekday/weekend

X: time

X: am/pm



And Y: numeric columns. Line plot. 



X: Sentence count in name, y: numeric columns values. One line each. 

X: Word count in name, y: numeric columns values. One line each. 



which word to start with: most frequent.
